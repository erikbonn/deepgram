This is a Frontend application that allows you to upload an audio file and then transcribe it into text that can be downloaded. I utilized UploadThing's file uploadloader/storage (think S3 wrapper) and Deepgram's API to basically make this a frontend only application deployed to Vercel using the T3 stack (see below for more info on T3). 

# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.
